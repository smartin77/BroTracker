# TODO List

This document contains deferred implementation, cleanup and refactoring tasks that should be remembered but do not belong to the project milestones.

It does not replace the project roadmap or milestone planning.

Items may be added during development when a task is identified but is not important enough to interrupt the current development step.

## Deferred Tasks

### Audio Diagnostics

* [x] Resolve recurring Teensy USB audio cold-boot corruption; hardware validation
  run `20261006-220244.Ph7ox3` passed. See the [validation record](../tools/teensy_usb_audio/README.md#hardware-validation-20261006-220244ph7ox3).
* [ ] Investigate intermittent ArkOS audio clicks/pauses and ALSA capture/playback
  xruns as a separate issue. Do not reopen the resolved cold-boot corruption
  without new evidence; see the same validation record for remaining observations.

* [ ] Move the current `AudioTestSource` test path from `firmware/teensy/BroTracker/` to `tools/teensy_diagnostics/`.

  * Keep it available as a Teensy audio hardware verification tool.
  * Keep production BroTracker runtime code separate from diagnostic/test-only code.
  * Update the build/integration path and documentation as necessary.
